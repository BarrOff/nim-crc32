# CRC32

CRC32 for Nim, 2 proc, based from RosettaCode.
Its just a `proc` so no much to document about it, just pass the thingy you want to do CRC.

- Works with `--gc:arc`, `--gc:orc`, `--panics:on`, `--experimental:strictFuncs`, C, C++, JavaScript.
- Uses `system.nim` only, does not import anything from stdlib.
